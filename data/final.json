I mentioned this on Twitter already: https://twitter.com/thetaph1/status/1498631483887689732\n\n@breskeby As you were working for Gradle before, maybe take your contacts and ask for including the plugin (which is only a few lines of Gradle-specific code) to the distribution and let people only configure the backend forbiddenapis JAR file (like this is done with other checkers like PMD or checkstyle which have plugin stubs in source code of Gradle and seem to be configurable to use a specific checkstyle/PMD backend). I will then only maintain the actual detection code, but I don't need to maintain the plugin in this ever-changing Gradle world which is a pain in the ass.\n\nI may have a solution for the current problem:\n- simply skip task execution on my own and remove the @SkipIfEmpty annotation. @reta already tried this out also in a first attempt to fix many other plugins for OpenSearch. From my checks this brings no performance problems, because you just move the check into the code if the FileTree is empty or not. Only downside is that it won't print \"NO-SOURCE\".\n- Do the same like done here in forbiddenapi's `plugin-init.groovy` by subclassing and use the subclassed Task class when Gradle 6.8 is detected.\n\nThe first fix would be easiest and works also with custom Task setup like done in Elasticsearch (looks like you have your own plugin code to setup, because you have many more sourcesets and also use forbiddenapis to scan JAR files going back to Robert Muir's code.\n\nIf you want to have the \"NO-SOURCE\" message back, you can do the same like done here: subclass.\n", "iteration": 2, "repo": "elastic/elasticsearch", "tag_post_qa": "no"}

The app would dynamically execute it and evaluate if the announcement should be shown. This approach gives us a lot of freedom for the future to check for specific conditions such as the patches or app version or other kinds of situations in which we may or may not want the user to show an announcement. This approach is better than assuming that certain information will be sufficient to determine if an announcement should be shown as proposed in this PR, where we assume the patch version will be sufficient.\n\nThis idea is similar to how Google operates DroidGuard, with the difference that it operates obfuscated, leading to the following concern: Because the client would download executables remotely, this could pose a security risk. The executable must be signed, and the signer must be trusted before the executable is run. In our case, the user must trust us as the signer. Once they trust us, they can check the executable's sign before running it in a trusted manner. The executable source has to be open as well and auditable. If the signer is untrusted, the executable will not be ran, and every announcement could be shown.\n\nIn terms of bandwidth, the announcement could come with an executable hash. The client can download the executable from a specific endpoint if the hash is present. If it is not present, no evaluation is necessary for that announcement. Evaluation is only necessary once/until the user dismisses the announcement.\n\nThis idea involves a lot of implementation and more thought and decisions before being realized which is why for now, the change in user agent should be done in a different PR in consideration to this idea.", "iteration": 1, "repo": "ReVanced/revanced-integrations", "tag_post_qa": "unclear"}

So in JDK default security provider, \"PKCS5Padding\" is a legacy name convention which also covers \"PKCS7Padding\" if I read a few related discussions correctly.\n\nFor example, this one here\nhttps://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/9043/what-is-the-difference-between-pkcs5-padding-and-pkcs7-padding\n```\nMany cryptographic libraries use an identifier indicating PKCS#5 or PKCS#7 to define the same padding \nmechanism. The identifier should indicate PKCS#7 if block sizes other than 8 are used within the calculation. \nSome cryptographic libraries such as the [SUN provider in Java](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs\n/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html#Cipher) indicate PKCS#5 where PKCS#7 should be used - \n\"PKCS5Padding\" should have been \"PKCS7Padding\". This is - with high probability - a legacy from the time \nthat only 8 byte block ciphers such as (triple) DES symmetric cipher were available.\n```\n\nAnd this one here\nhttps://copyprogramming.com/howto/java-security-nosuchalgorithmexception-cannot-find-any-provider-supporting-aes-ecb-pkcs7padding\n```\n The Sun JCE provider, which is Java's implementation, required a padding method for block size of 16 bytes.\n To fulfill this requirement, PKCS#7 specifies a padding method that is similar to PKCS#5 padding. The only \ndifference is that PKCS#7 padding is defined for block sizes ranging from 2 to 255 bytes, which is the \nmaximum value of a byte if it encodes a zero-based unsigned integer. However, the padding method was \nalready available with the name \"PKCS5Padding\" . Instead of introducing a new name, the existing name \n\"PKCS5Padding\" was utilized.\n\n\nAt this point, it is crucial that the Sun provider offers support for \"PKCS7Padding\" since PKCS#5 padding is \nnot appropriate. This is not only a problem for Java Naming issue , but it affects all developers who are \nattempting to implement cryptographic protocols or transfer other software to Java. While waiting for the Sun \nprovider to offer support, it is recommended to use \"PKCS5Padding\" instead of \"PKCS7Padding\" . \n\n```", "iteration": 2, "repo": "apache/cxf", "tag_post_qa": "unclear"}

I did it mainly as a precaution (malicious queries like g.V().drop().iterate() can happen and JanusGraph user might not have control over it).\n\nI see. I would probably like to have a small debate about it because it gives users a false feeling that you can safely expose script evaluation and it will be guaranteed that anything they execute there will be read-only. If we talk specifically about malicious queries then this script engine should be way more protected. For example, I didn't test this query myself but what would happen to the next evaluation?\n```\ng2 = ((JanusGraph) g.getGraph()).buildTransaction().start().traversal(); g2.V().drop().iterate(); g2.tx().commit();\n```\nMoreover, by exposing script evaluation you literally giving access to the whole JVM and by accessing it you can do whatever you want with the server. For example, someone could get a dump of the whole memory or get some credentials, or access the network this machine is hosted in, etc. \nBy giving such access to the user you should probably limit a lot of things in the script evaluation engine (at least following some guideline from TinkerPop [here](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#script-execution)).\nCreating a secure evaluation would be really great but that requires us to configure gremlin script engine quite a bit.\nSo, I would probably not consider it as a protection against malicious script. Thus, I don't see any reason why this specific traversal is read-only. If a user doesn't want to change anything - they should not write any scripts which changes data.\nIf we proceed with the read-only default traversal then I bet we will have a feature request soon to allow traversal to write some data, or even worse, users may start using hacks like:\n```\ng2 = ((JanusGraph) g.getGraph()).buildTransaction().start().traversal(); g2.addV(\"dummy\").next(); g2.tx().commit();\n```\nSo, I guess I would actually make `read-only` traversal creation as an optional feature. Moreover I would explain that it simply creates a read-only traversal but it doesn't protect users from creating `write` transactions inside scripts. I would also probably add some documentation which says that it isn't safe to expose this evaluation to clients as it doesn't protect from executing arbitrary code.

Report processing inserts a delimiter into the storage\u2019s doubly linked list, moves reported blocks to the head of the storage\u2019s list, then uses the delimiter to determine excess blocks for invalidation. The updating of so many references creates intense pressure on GC.\n>\n> One reason is young gen maintains a tenuring threshold equating to how conservatively it will promote young gen objects into old gen. The threshold drops relative to the rate of garbage creation and dirtying of old gen cards. The young collector may resort to prematurely promoting objects into old gen when it becomes overrun by spending too much time collecting. CMS is forced to cleanup when the old gen occupancy threshold is exceeded. The prematurely promoted objects lead to excessive fragmentation of old gen.\n>\n> We can reduce abusive GC behavior by reducing the mutation of references in old gen.\nUnlike references, updating primitives (ints, longs, etc) does not mark an old gen page dirty.

Then the application may switch to `XsuaaTokenComp` until complete migration.\n\nFor this purpose, the following signatures are incompatible:\n```Java\n\n\t@Nullable\n\tString getOrigin() { // This is public in com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa.token.XsuaaToken\n\t\treturn token.getClaimAsString(TokenClaims.XSUAA.ORIGIN);\n\t}\n\n// ...\n\n\tpublic String getExpirationDate() { // Date is returned in com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa.token.XsuaaToken\n\t\treturn token.getExpiration() != null ? Date.from(token.getExpiration()).toString() : null;\n\t}\n\n```\n\nThe `XsuaaToken` class extends `Jwt` and implements `com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa.token.Token` which are both not present in `XsuaaTokenComp`.\nScenarios with `Jwt` or `com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa.token.Token` still would break.\n\nWhat about providing a separate maven artifact (xsuaa-fallback / xsuaa-compatibility) with a slightly modified `com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa.token.XsuaaToken` where the constructor adapts from AccessToken to XsuaaToken?\n(+ the required `com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa.token.Token` dependency)\n\nExample:\n```Java\nAccessToken token = SpringSecurityContext.getAccessToken();\nXsuaaToken xsuaaToken = XsuaaToken.createInstance(token);\n```\n\nThen you can preserve the old API without introducing API changes and you don't get legacy code in the `spring-security` artifact.\nThere would be no major refactoring effort and only the construction need to be adapted (as in the current PR).\nThe separate module can be removed by the consumers after completing the migration.\n\nComing back to the original question...\n\nI think it is not an adapter because it is an incompatible type (other inheritance, different name, different package). Secondly, you typically don't use an adapter as API. It operates as an implementation for a given interface.\n`XsuaaTokenComp` is an \"on method signature compatible\" class.\n\nMy proposal is to go with a separate compatibility module.\nIf not, then I tend to something like `XsuaaTokenComp` or (less nice) `XsuaaTokenSubst` or (less nice) `XsuaaTokenAlias`.\n", "iteration": 1, "repo": "SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library", "tag_post_qa": "no"}

Consider providing more context about why the creator class abstraction is necessary.\n\n5. **Compatibility:** Compatibility issues are not apparent based on the given code snippet.\n\n6. **Simplicity:** The code appears to be straightforward and simple.\n\n7. **Optimization Points:**\n   - It's not clear if `metastoreType` is a required parameter for constructing `HiveMetastore`. If it is optional or could use a default value, consider making it an optional parameter with a default value in the constructor.\n   - Review the condition where `enableMetastoreCache` is checked. If caching is a common scenario, it might be worth optimizing the code further to utilize caching when it is enabled.\n\nImproved code patch:\n\n```java\npublic IHiveMetastore createHiveMetastore() {\n    // TODO(stephen): Abstract the creator class to construct hive meta client\n    HiveMetaClient metaClient = HiveMetaClient.createHiveMetaClient(hdfsEnvironment, properties);\n    IHiveMetastore hiveMetastore = new HiveMetastore(metaClient, catalogName, metastoreType);\n    IHiveMetastore baseHiveMetastore;\n    if (!enableMetastoreCache) {\n        baseHiveMetastore = hiveMetastore;\n    }\n    // Rest of the code...\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that without additional context or the complete codebase, it's challenging to provide more specific or accurate suggestions. It's always recommended to do a thorough review of the entire codebase and consider other factors such as performance requirements, architectural considerations, and project-specific conventions.", "tag_pre_qa": "bot"}
